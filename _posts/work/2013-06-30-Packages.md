*I originally presented this idea as a lightning talk at SciPy-2013.  I repeat it here because it received considerably more attention than my actual talk.*

We start with the following principle

Principle: *Refactor repeated code into a separate module/package*

Which is illustrated with the following pair of images

Invariably packages contain code of varying general utility.  Scientific codes often target specific applications (like genome sequencing of the fruit fly) but also contain some generally applicable routines (like fuzzy string matching).  These general routines have great potential value to the broader community but are unfortunately sequestered by the special-case application code.

Problem:  Packages unnecessarily tie together general code specific code.

Solution:  Extract general components to separate packages.  Import these packages into application specific code.


Absurdity
---------

As with all good lightning talks, we take the idea to absurdity.

Invariably even the extracted general project will have components of more or less generality.  We repeat our principle and separate code of varying degrees of generality.  This practice produces packages of boundless granularity.

Intermediate projects become empty collections of imports.  We remove them and find a sea of atomic packages with dependencies.  Our application code becomes much smaller due to the sea of generally applicable code.


GroupBy
-------

The talk then discussed `groupby`, a particular general function to group a collection by the action of a function.  Groupby is discussed in more detail in [a previous blog post.](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2013/05/21/GroupBy/)
    
    names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dan', 'Edith', 'Frank']
    assert groupby(len, names) == {3: ['Bob', 'Dan'],
                                   5: ['Alice', 'Edith', 'Frank'],
                                   7: ['Charlie']}

I love `groupby`.  I implement it in most of my projects.  For example here is a grep of my workspace directory:

    mrocklin/workspace$ ack-grep "def groupby" */*/*.py 

    computations/computations/util.py
    80:def groupby(f, coll):

    itertoolz/itertoolz/core.py
    17:def groupby(f, coll):

    logpy/logpy/util.py
    90:def groupby(f, coll):

    megatron/megatron/util.py
    25:def groupby(f, coll):

    term/term/util.py
    90:def groupby(f, coll):

    tompkins/tompkins/util.py
    55:def groupby(f, coll):

Clearly this is sub-optimal.  We should put it into a package.

*In which package does `groupby` belong?*

One could imagine placing it in a new [`itertoolz`](https://github.com/mrocklin/itertoolz/) library because it consumes iterators.  Or perhaps a `dicttoolz` because it produces a dict.  Or perhaps a new `functoolz` because it is a higher order function like `map` or `filter`.  Each of these utility libraries could use `groupby`.  Our principle to *separate general code from specific code* dictates that the ideal package is the intersection of all larger packages.

The result is that `groupby` lives in its own project

{% highlight python %}
from groupby import groupby
{% endhighlight %}

This seems absurd.


Discussion
----------

This talk generated significantly more discussion than my real talk.  Here are some of the thoughts that came out of subsequent conversations with other SciPy developers.  If you have thoughts please list them in the comments.  I'm happy to modify this post to reflect your views.


#### Cross package testing is difficult

We often test interactions between different functions.  We don't have good tooling for testing across packages.  So if we want to separate functions into different packages then we have a testing problem.  We don't have good tooling for cross package testing.


#### Development and prototyping across packages is difficult

Developing new code with uncertain and dynamic interfaces is challenging.  Doing this with each function in a separate repository requires constant juggling.  Git repositories introduce significant amounts of state into the development process requiring a significant mental load.


#### Package management has issues

I made the claim during my talk that managing dependencies is cheap.  Many people brought up good issues with this and rightly so.  Particularly non-Python dependencies and versioning both cause significant issues.


My Thoughts
-----------

Changing the granularity of dependencies from packages to functions clearly breaks current models of development.  I do not encourage the community to take this model literally.  Instead, I hope that people move in the direction of separating general code from specific code and using dependency managers more aggressively.  Principles are good and I believe that this one is both valuable and challenging for us all.  Of course, principles must be moderated with pragmatism.

Given that, I'm now going to talk about how one might resolve the issues above in a fantasy world.  The motivation is that *granular software ecosystems enable software evolution*.


#### Separate `source` from `tests`

Testing code need not be associated one-to-one with source code.   Several different implementations can satisfy the same tests.  We want to encourage several competing implementations; this competition enables growth and flexibility.  Ease of competition is critical for a healthy and dynamic ecosystem.

For example, the testing function [`test_groupby`](https://gist.github.com/mrocklin/5722155) clearly specifies the requirements for the `groupby` function.  I satisfy this test with my implementation of [`groupby`](https://gist.github.com/mrocklin/5618992).  Because these exist separately my implementation has no elevated status.  Others may implement code to satisfy this test with equal voice.  

*Elevating test suites to first class packages establishes clear interfaces and promotes competition*

Source code does not depend on other source code; it depends on a consistent interface.  Tests are one way to specify this interface.  It is not the case that `scipy` depends on `numpy`.  Rather, `scipy` depends on code that satisfies the `numpy` test suite.  Accepting this separation enables alternative implementations (like [`DyND`](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/dynd-python) or [`Odin`](http://blog.enthought.com/general/enthought-awarded-1m-doe-sbir-grant-to-develop-open-source-python-hpc-framework/)) to more easily displace NumPy.  This evolution is critical to the evolution of existing scientific Python software to adapt to changing hardware.


#### Tooling can follow need

Many of the problems involve existing tools (Python package managers, git.)  These problems are surmountable with new tools and programmer communities are excellent at tool construction for new challenges.  `git` was developed to support a single large open source community when `svn` failed to scale.  Frustrations with existing package managers have lead to new developments like the [`conda`](http://docs.continuum.io/conda/).

If the scientific Python community adopts higher granularity in package organization then I am confident that tool developers and enthusiasts will move to support those practices.


Final Thoughts
--------------

The main point is 

*Please do this*

The second point is: 

The challenges of software distribution have changed since when we first developed packages.  Building software is still difficult but we've come a very long way.  We should rethink development practices particularly on the community codebase.  We should analyze how those practices affect the strength and adaptability of our ecosystem.
