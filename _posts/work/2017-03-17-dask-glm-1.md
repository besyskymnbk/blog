Summary
-------

We discuss building distributed optimization algorithms with Dask.  We show
both some simple examples and benchmarks.  We also talk about the experience of
learning Dask to do this kind of work.

This blogpost is co-authored by Chris White (Capital One) who knows
optimization and Matthew Rocklin (Continuum Analytics) who knows distributed
computing.


Introduction
------------

Many machine learning and statistics algorithms like logistic regression depend
on convex optimization algorithms like Newton's method, stochastic gradient
descent, and others.  These optimization algorithms are both pragmatic (they're
used in many applications) and mathematically interesting.  As a result these
algorithms have been the subject of study by researchers and graduate students
around the world for years both in academia and in industry.

Things got interesting about five or ten years ago when datasets grew beyond
the size of working memory and "Big Data" became a buzzword.  Now parallel and
distributed solutions for these algorithms have become the norm, and a
researcher's skillset now has to extend beyond linear algebra and optimization
theory to include parallel algorithms and possibly even network programming,
especially if you want to explore and create more interesting algorithms.

1.  Algorithmic researcher (Chris): someone who knows optimization and
    iterative algorithms like ***,  (TODO: Chris fill in) but isn't so hot on
    distributed computing topics like sockets, MPI, load balancing, etc..
2.  Distributed systems/Dask developer (Matt): someone who knows how to move
    bytes around and keep machines busy but doesn't know the right way to do a
    line search or handle a poorly conditioned matrix

Experiment
----------

*We compare dask-glm implementations against Scikit-learn on a laptop, and then
show them running on a cluster.*

*Reproducible notebook is available here: TODO*

We've already done the work above, and more, in the nascent [dask-glm
project](https://github.com/dask/dask-glm).  This project has convex
optimization algorithms for gradient descent, proximal gradient descent,
newton's method, and ADMM.  These implementations extend the implementations
above by also thinking about stopping criteria and other niceties that we
avoided above for simplicity.

how off these algorithms we're going to perform a simple numerical experiment
that compares the numerical performance of proximal gradient descent and ADMM
alongside Scikit-Learn's LogisiticRegression and SGD implementations on a
single machine (a personal laptop) and then follows up by scaling the dask-glm
options to a moderate cluster.  As a disclaimer, these experiments will be
somewhat crude.  We're using artificial data, we're not tuning parameters or
even finding parameters at which these algorithms are producing results of the
same accuracy.  The goal of this section is just to give a general feeling of
how things compare.

We create data

```python
## size of problem (no. observations)
N = 8e6
chunks = 1e6
seed = 20009
beta = (np.random.random(15) - 0.5) * 3

X = da.random.random((N,len(beta)), chunks=chunks)
y = make_y(X, beta=np.array(beta), chunks=chunks)

X, y = persist(X, y)
client.rebalance([X, y])
```

And run each of our algorithms as follows:

```python
# Dask-GLM Proximal Gradient
proximal_grad(X, y, lamduh=alpha)

# Dask-GLM ADMM
X2 = X.rechunk((1e5, None)).persist()  # ADMM prefers smaller chunks
y2 = y.rechunk(1e5).persist()
result = admm(X2, y2, lamduh=alpha)

# Scikit-Learn LogisticRegression
nX, ny = compute(X, y)  # sklearn wants numpy arrays
LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', C=1).fit(nX, ny).coef_

# Scikit-Learn Stochastic Gradient Descent
SGDClassifier(loss='log',
              penalty='l1',
              l1_ratio=1,
              n_iter=10,
              fit_intercept=False).fit(nX, ny).coef_
```

We then compare with the $L_{\infty}$ norm (largest different value).

```python
abs(result - beta).max()
```

Times and accuracies for these parameters are shown in the table below:

<table>
<thead><tr>
  <th>Algorithm</th>
  <th>Error</th>
  <th>Duration (s)</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Proximal Gradient</td>
  <td>0.0227</td>
  <td>128</td>

  <td>SGDClassifier</td>

Again, please don't take these numbers too seriously.  TODO: Chris add
disclaimers.  Also, Dask-glm is using a full four-core laptop while SKLearn is
restricted to use a single core.


TODO Matt: Add profile plots
